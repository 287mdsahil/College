# Future technology predictions

## *Somethings we know are coming*

### 1. **Cloud Gaming**

There are around 1.8 billion gamers around the world. The gaming industry is already incredible wealthy, with an estimated revenue of $78.61 billion for 2017 alone. The industry is growing with an exponential pace with the advent of platforms like *Twitch* for streaming and *Discord* for community communications. But gaming, which may initially seem irrelevant, has a big role to play in pushing computers to be more efficient.

Since the advent of computers and other electronic devices, the development of these devices has mainly been pushed by the need. Computers are becoming faster and more efficient due to need and demand for more powerful computing. One of the most demanding job that personal computers has to offer is gaming. Game developers always find ways to make games better, often at the cost of computation. Huge graphical and simulation jobs push the computer hardware to their extreme limits. Its fair to say that the hardware advancements of personal computers has by far not been in par with the advancements of computer simulated video games. Developers have come up with unique solution to this problem , *Cloud gaming*.

The idea is that the heavy computational load of the games is done on a cloud server, and the local computer just video streams the game. Cloud gaming servers can be way more powerful than personal computers thus overcoming the performance barrier. The biggest barrier to this idea is *latency*.
The time required by the local controller to register an event on the cloud server is bottle-necked by the the network efficiency. Developers are still working on optimizing this latency. Companies like *Shadow*, even the tech giant *Google* with its coming soon cloud gaming platform *Stadia* will very soon hit the markets and change the gaming industry for ever.

But why stay limited to gaming! Why not change the whole personal computing experience.

### 2. **Driver less cars**

Traffic jams are a menace. More disturbing is the fact that its only cause if human error. Theoretically with automated cars there will be no traffic jams. There even will be no need for traffic lights. *Tesla* has already tested their driverless autopilot system on UK roads. *Google*, *Apple*, *BMW*, *AUDI* are also working on developing their own driver less cars.

### 3. **5G network**

The successor of 4G is set to take over the communication world. With cellphone companies like *Samsung* and *Apple* already announcing their 5G phone variants, the revolution is more closer than we think it is.

## *Somethings that may shape the future*

### 1. **Cloud personal computers**

Cloud computing is already a thing with platforms such as *Google Cloud Platform*, *Microsoft Azure*, *AWS* already available in the market. But what if the whole os of all our devices is run in the cloud! The heavy computation will be done in the powerful cloud servers and the

### 2. **AI assistants**

### 3. **Flexible and transparent display technology**

### 4. **Right to open source software**

### 4. **Robots taking over the human race**

Nah, just kidding. ;)
