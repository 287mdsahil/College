# Readme file

### Implementation
##### Here are the list of classes and files used:
1. `Dict/` : Directory that stores the tokens for different types in seperate files
2. `Dictionary` : Class that generates the dictionary.
3. `TokenList` : Container class for tokens
4. `WordTokenizer` : Class with methods to read data from the input file and extract tokens.
5. `Symtab` : Symtab object class
6. `LexicalAnalyzer` : Class with methods to run the lexical analyzer.

##### All the above files are placed in the package `lexicalAnalyzer`.
The `run.java` class contains the main method and runs the methods in the `LexicalAnalyzer` class.

### In order to run the program use the following command:
`$ javac run.java`

`$ java run`

The program asks for an input file. There is sample file provided named as "input" with some random text on it.
The output is produced in the screen. Also the output is saved in a file named `SymtabOutput`.

### The following is the ouput generated by the sample
