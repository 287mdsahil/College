You’ll be the last thing I think of before I fall asleep and the first thing I think of when I wake up.
May you dream of lovely things and to find them real.
Each day I wish that my dreams will come true. Then I remember that I am now with you.
Each night you sleep is a signal that a new beginning awaits you.
One day, we will never have to say goodbye, only goodnight.
Wake up with determination. Go to bed with satisfaction.
Touch your heart and shut your eyes, dream sweet dreams and sleep tight.
I wish I was there to hold you tight, instead of just sending you this loving “Good Night”.
It was the possibility of darkness that made the day seem so bright. – Stephen King
Good night, and good luck. – Edward R. Murrow
Here is to hoping that angels will guard you while you dream and the gentle breezes of the night will keep you cool. If it is too cold, may your blankets be warm as you drift on to a gentle rest.
Day is over, night has come. Today is gone, what’s done is done. Embrace your dreams, through the night. Tomorrow comes with a whole new light.
God’s guidance is like a small lamp in a dark forest… Doesn’t show everything at once… But gives enough light for the next step to be safe. Goodnight!
Night is to see the dreams and day is to make them true. So its good to sleep now and see the dreams. Good Night!
Always end the day, with a positive thought. No matter how hard things were, tomorrow’s a fresh opportunity to make it better.
Stars can’t shine without darkness.
If it comes back, I think that Friday night is not a good night to be on. – Amber Tamblyn
Love is one of the simplest feelings. All I dream about is capturing your heart each night. You already have my heart.
I don’t dream about you, because I can never fall asleep thinking about you.
All I wish that I could be there to say good night instead of sending you this message.
